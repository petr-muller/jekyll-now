### More Information

I'm a software quality engineer with expertise in Linux and Open Source
software. I have tested my share of software, from testing GUI applications to
finding bugs in low-level OS plumbing that most programmers take for granted. I
wrote testing tools. I led a team of engineers. I spoke on SW conferences about
technical topics, and I have created and taught courses and workshops.

I like to learn and experiment with new programming languages. I love the tools
which help programmers and testers create flawless software. My great interest
are various automated bug hunting tools, from easy-to-use practical utilities
to hacked-together rough research prototypes.
